The default setting uses a compute resource provided by the authors with limitations on CPU, memory, and concurrent jobs, shared among all users. This public resource should only be used for testing with small jobs.

First you will need to provision the base AWS Batch infrastructure using CDK. This includes IAM roles, VPC, Security Group, EFS filesystems, Batch Compute Environments and Batch Job Queues. Next you will need to configure your compute resource controller to submit jobs to AWS Batch. Finally, when you submit jobs from the web interface, you must select aws_batch as the run method.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"What is Dendro?","description":"PyPI version","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"}}}')}}]);
